# CorneLP_Case
A simple 5x3 Corne case to be used with low profile switches.

The final exported file has the mcu cutout filled in with a .2mm thick layer, this is to help with print adhesion. Just cut that away with a hobby knife. 
It fits quite tightly around the mcu, however this makes for the very clean visual style. 

.f3z also added, please don't ridicule my horrible timeline ^^
